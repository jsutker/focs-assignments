[ ] I completed this assignment without assistance or external resources.
[X] I completed this assignment with assistance from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form (to remember what exactly CNF is)
```

## I. Formal Proofs

Use the rules of inference from class (reprinted below) to construct formal, numbered proofs of the following:

### 1. 

Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

Assuming _p_ (since no conclusions can be drawn otherwise)

1) _p -> q_ (Truth Assignment)

2) _q_ (1, MP)

3) _p -> r_ (Truth Assignment)

4) _r_ (2, MP)

5) _q AND r_ (2, 4, Con)

Thus, when _p_, _q AND r_ (i.e.: _p -> (q AND r)_)

### 2.

Assuming _p -> (q OR r)_ and _p -> (q OR NOT r)_, prove _p -> q_

Assuming _p_ (since no conclustions can be drawn otherwise)

1) _p -> (q OR r) (Truth Assignment)

2) _p -> (q OR NOT r) (Truth Assignment)

3) _p -> ((q OR r) AND (q OR NOT r))_ (1, 2, previous proof)

4) _(q OR r) AND (q OR NOT r)_ (3, MP)

5) _q OR (r AND NOT r)_ (4, distributive)

6) _q OR F_ (5, negation)

7) _q_ (6, identity)

Thus, when _p_, _q_ (i.e.: _p -> q_)

## II. Truth tables

Use a truth table to show the equivalence of the assumptions and conclusion from problem 1, above:  Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

[Style note:  what is the canonical order of the rows in a truth table for three propositions?]

```
p | q | r | p->q | p->r | p->(q&r)
-----------------------------------
F | F | F |  T   |  T   |    T    | Y
-----------------------------------
F | F | T |  T   |  T   |    T    | Y
-----------------------------------
F | T | F |  T   |  T   |    T    | Y
-----------------------------------
F | T | T |  T   |  T   |    T    | Y
-----------------------------------
T | F | F |  F   |  F   |    F    | N, but p->q=F and p->r=F
-----------------------------------
T | F | T |  F   |  T   |    F    | N, but p->q=F
-----------------------------------
T | T | F |  T   |  F   |    F    | N, but p->r=F
-----------------------------------
T | T | T |  T   |  T   |    T    | Y
```

## III. Tautology, satisfiable, contradiction

Which of the following are tautologies?  Satisfiable?  Unsatisfiable (contradictions)?

### 1. _(p AND q AND r) -> (p OR q)_

Tautology (p AND q AND r is true, thus p, q, and r must be true, thus p OR q is true)

### 2. _((p -> q) AND (q -> r)) -> (p -> r)_

Tautology (Transitivity)

### 3. _(p -> q) -> p_

Satisfiable (if p is true)

### 4. _(p OR q OR r) AND ((NOT p) OR (NOT q) OR (NOT r)) AND (p OR (NOT q)) AND (q OR (NOT r)) OR (r OR (not p))_ 

Satisfiable (if r is true)

### 5. [** challenge/optional] _(p <=> (q OR r)) -> ((NOT q) -> (p AND r))_

Satisfiable (with p and r both true, even though they could also both be false)

## IV. CNF

Transform the following formula into conjunctive normal form.  Show your steps.

_p OR (q AND NOT (r AND (s -> t)))_

_p|(q&!(r&(s->t)))_

_p|(q&!(r&(!s|t)))_

_p|(q&(!r|(s&!t)))_

_(p|q)&(p|(!r|(s&!t)))_

_(p|q)&(p|!r|(s&!t))_

_(p|q)&(p|!r|s)&(p|!r|!t)_

## V. Short certificate

Demonstrate that the formula in problem IV is satisfiable.  Explain whether you used a  "short certificate" or exhaustive enumeration to make this determination.

Of course it's satisfiable. If you make P true, then the whole thing is always true no matter what the other variables are ("short certificate").
